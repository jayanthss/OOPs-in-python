# 📄 Full Explanation and Code in a Single File

- ✨ For example, if you want to learn the basics, just open the syntax file and go through it line by line. 📌 I designed it so that you don’t need to switch between multiple files—you can stay in the same file and learn everything.

- 💡 If you don’t understand something at first, don’t worry—it’s completely normal. 🔁 After reading it a couple of times or practicing two to three times, you’ll understand it automatically.
